Put the IPs of the devices you want to run the commands on in IPs.txt

Put the non config commands you want to run in Lines.txt

The program will prompt you for the account to login to the devices, run the commands on the devices then put all the output in 1 file.

You should be able to easly split the devices into diffrent output files just by setting the file_name = ip+.txt in the send_lines function.
